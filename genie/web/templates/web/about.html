						<h3>What Is Big Blue's Parking Genie?</h3>
						<p>You know how home owners near universities often charge people to park in their driveways for football games? Most of the time, if you want to park in a local's driveway, you have to show up extra early or park extra far away. Big Blue's Parking Genie aims to resolve this issue with a parking reservation app for Utah State University Events. Here, you can either buy and reserve a parking spot ahead of time or list your own parking spots. Our goal is to connect drivers to parking lots (or driveways) before the event. Doing so saves time, prevents stress, and decreases wandering traffic.</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>What Role Should I Sign Up For?</h3>
								<p>There are four separate roles: University Admin, Parking Lot Owner, Parking Lot Attendant, and Customer. If you'd like to reserve a parking spot, go ahead and sign up as a Customer. If you'd like to list your own personal parking lot or driveway, register as a Parking Lot Owner. If your friend has asked you to be their parking lot bouncer, register as a Parking Lot Attendant. You should only register as a University Administrator if you work for the University and have been asked to sign up as that.</p>

								<h3>Who Are The Creators?</h3>
								<p>We are a team goes by the name The Djinns. The four of us (Joel Christensen, Autumn Arbon, Lexy Simmons, and Palani Johnson) have created this for the purpose of fulfilling a school project and to fulfill a need in the community. We are all working toward Bachelor Degrees in Computer Science. We are motivated by two things: our desires to receive those degrees and our mascots (Palani's cats) Mei Mei and Pup.</p>
