Sprint 2 Retrospective:
-----------------------

What went well:
---------------
  - 1 html page left
  - all but 1 html page connected to Django
  - Map API is mostly functional - can show an event and lot locations on map

  Functionality working so far:
    - reserve spot, still needs to render lots and spots according to previous selections
    - login/create account
    - main page showing upcoming events and conditional rendering

What didn't go well:
--------------------
  - Still have work to do on maps
  - Didn't get as much functionality done

What specific things we can do to improve:
-------------------------------------------
  - Have at least something little done by each standup meeting
